## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tachyons

This app was made to reflect a directory that displays employee profiles and contact information. 


## Lessons Learned:

This was my first exposure to accessing public API's. I learned that frameworks make accessing API's a dream! I also learned how to play with JSON response objects to access the data needed and dynamically render components.
